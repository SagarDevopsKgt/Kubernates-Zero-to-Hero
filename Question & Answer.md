What problems does Kubernetes solve that Docker alone does not support or handle effectively?

---

### 1. **Orchestration of Multiple Containers Across Multiple Hosts**

* **Problem:** Docker can run and manage containers, but it doesn’t manage a large fleet of containers spread across multiple servers.
* **Kubernetes solves this by:**

  * Distributing containers across a **cluster** of machines.
  * Ensuring **high availability**, **scalability**, and **load balancing** across nodes.
  * Automatically rescheduling failed containers on healthy nodes.

---

### 2. **Self-Healing and Auto-Restart**

* **Problem:** Docker can restart containers on failure, but it lacks sophisticated self-healing mechanisms.
* **Kubernetes adds:**

  * Automatic **container restarts**, **rescheduling**, and **replica management**.
  * If a container or node fails, K8s automatically moves workloads to healthy nodes.

---

### 3. **Auto-scaling (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**

* **Problem:** Docker doesn't scale containers based on CPU/memory usage automatically.
* **Kubernetes handles:**

  * **Horizontal scaling** of pods (containers) based on real-time resource usage or custom metrics.
  * **Cluster Autoscaler** that adds/removes nodes as needed.

---

### 4. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**

* **Problem:** Docker Compose doesn’t provide out-of-the-box service discovery for containers across multiple hosts.
* **Kubernetes offers:**

  * Built-in **service discovery** using DNS.
  * **Load balancing** across replicas of services.

---

### 5. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**

* **Problem:** Docker lacks built-in mechanisms for zero-downtime deployments and rollbacks.
* **Kubernetes provides:**

  * **Rolling updates** to gradually replace containers with new versions.
  * **Automated rollbacks** if something breaks during deployment.

---

### 6. **Configuration and Secrets Management**

* **Problem:** Docker can pass environment variables but lacks full configuration and secrets management.
* **Kubernetes supports:**

  * Native **Secrets** and **ConfigMaps** to separate sensitive and non-sensitive configuration.
  * Dynamically inject secrets and configs into pods.

---

### 7. **Persistent Storage Management**

* **Problem:** Docker supports volumes but lacks abstraction for managing storage across a cluster.
* **Kubernetes adds:**

  * **PersistentVolume** and **PersistentVolumeClaim** to decouple storage from pods.
  * Integration with cloud providers’ storage backends (EBS, GCE, NFS, etc.).

---

### 8. **Multi-Tenant Support and Namespaces**

* **Problem:** Docker has no concept of logical isolation beyond containers.
* **Kubernetes introduces:**

  * **Namespaces** to isolate workloads, teams, or environments in the same cluster.
  * RBAC and quota management per namespace.

---

### 9. **Declarative Infrastructure Management**

* **Problem:** Docker is primarily imperative—you tell it what to do.
* **Kubernetes is declarative:**

  * You define the **desired state** in YAML/JSON files, and K8s ensures the system matches that state.
  * Better suited for **GitOps** and CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 10. **Health Checks and Lifecycle Hooks**

* **Problem:** Docker supports basic health checks but limited integration.
* **Kubernetes supports:**

  * **Liveness** and **readiness probes** to manage container lifecycle more effectively.
  * Hooks for preStop, postStart, etc.

### TL;DR:

| Feature                        | Docker  | Kubernetes |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| Multi-host orchestration       | ❌       | ✅          |
| Auto-scaling                   | ❌       | ✅          |
| Load balancing                 | Limited | ✅          |
| Self-healing                   | Limited | ✅          |
| Rolling updates                | ❌       | ✅          |
| Config/secrets management      | Basic   | ✅          |
| Persistent storage abstraction | Basic   | ✅          |
| Namespaces & multi-tenancy     | ❌       | ✅          |

If you’re using Docker alone, it’s great for local development and running single-node workloads. But Kubernetes is essential when you need **scalability**, **high availability**, and **automated orchestration** in production environments.
